# Bioinformatics for Influenza Genome Reconstruction: A Hands-On Workshop
# Day 02: Conda

## Lesson Objectives
* Learn to utilize four different conda subcommands

### List all available conda environments
One of the `conda` subcommands is `conda info`.

```bash
# look at all conda environments available to you
conda info --envs
``` 
### Install a new conda environment from a "recipe"
As shown in the lecture conda environments can be summarized in a environment file in YAML format. We will look at one such environment file, then use `conda env` to install it.

```bash
# there are many ways to view a file, we will use cat to do it
cat /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/envs/bcftools.yaml

# now to install the environment
conda env create -n bcftools -f /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/envs/bcftools.yaml
```

The `conda env` command was called with the paramteter `-n` which gives the environment the name `bcftools` and with `-f` which tells conda the location of the recipe file.


As a minor exercise, make sure that the environment was installed with the given name (bcftools).
```bash
# look at all conda environments available to you, again

``` 

The `conda activate` command lets you switch to a specific environment. You can use any of the environments that were listed in the output of the last command. Once you have activated you will be able to use the software that is installed in that environment
```bash
# try to use bcftools
bcftools
```
you should receive this error message 
```bash
Command 'bcftools' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install bcftools
```
We have to activate the environment first to use `bcftools`. The we can use the `bcftools`.
```bash
# activate the environment that we just created
conda activate bcftools
# now the following should give you no error
bcftools
```
