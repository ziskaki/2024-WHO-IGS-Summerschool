# Bioinformatics for Influenza Genome Reconstruction: A Hands-On Workshop
# Day 03: Setting up

## Lesson Objectives
* Get set up for day 3

### Set up for the day

```bash
# Go to the nambi24 folder

# Create the folder day03

# Go inside day03
``` 

We will need some data to run all of the commands on. Copy the following example file to this directory. The example file is in `/home/mf1/nambi24/data/ERR11787143.fastq.gz`

```bash
# Copy example file here. Do not forget the dot at the end of the command to indicate the target is "here"
cp /home/mf1/nambi24/data/ERR11787143.fastq.gz .

# We will rename our sample to have a shorter name 
mv ERR11787143.fastq.gz s1.fastq.gz

``` 

The other files we need for the day are: 
- /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/refs/download/Pan_Influenza_refseq_genomes_meta.csv
- /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/refs/download/Pan_Influenza_refseq_genomes.fna
- /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/refs/download/Pan_Influenza_refseq_genomes.fna.fai

```bash
# Copy these other files to day03 (or "here" if you are in day03)
```
