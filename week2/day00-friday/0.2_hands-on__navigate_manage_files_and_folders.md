# Bioinformatics for Influenza Genome Reconstruction

## Synopsis

### Navigate between folders
You can use the tool ```cd``` (change directory) to move between folders in a hierarchial way. Changing directory on the command line means changing the current directory to the target directory.

The command pattern of `cd` is:
 ```cd <target>```
where ```<target>``` is the (relative or absolute) path to your target directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the working directory of this training
cd ~/nambi24

# Navigate one directory up
cd ..

# Navigate to another directory 
cd Documents

# Navigate to your home directory
cd

# Navigate to the directory you have last been in
cd -

# Learn more about the cd command
cd --help
```

* _How can you move in one command to a directory that is located two levels up?_


### Absolute and relative paths


```bash
# List the content 
ls /home/nambi24

# List the content of another directory
ls /home/nambi24/data

# Go to data using either relative or absolute path

# Go to /home using a relative path

# Go to nambi24 using an absolute path

# Go to data using a relative path

```

## Manage files and folders
### Copy files between folders
```cp``` is a tool that copies data (duplicates). 

The command has the following pattern: 
```cp <source> <target>```

```bash
# Navigate to ~

# Create a file copy_me.txt
touch copy_me.txt

# Verify - How?

# Navigate to nambi24

# Copy the file copy_me.txt to "here"
cp ../copy_me.txt .

# Verify

# Go back to home

# Create a copy of the file copy_me.txt that and name it move_me.txt
cp copy_me.txt move_me.txt

# Create a second copy of the file and name it delete_me.txt

# Learn more about the command cp
man cp
```

### Move files between folders
```mv``` is a tool that moves and/or renames data (removes source). 

The command has the following pattern
```mv <source> <target>```

```bash

# Navigate to the nambi24 directory

# Move a file from /home to "here"
mv ../move_me.txt .

# Verify

# Rename file
mv move_me.txt renamed.txt

# Verify

# Learn more about the command mv
man mv
```

### Remove files
```rm``` is a tool that removes data. Always be 100% sure what you delete, because once a file or directory is deleted, you cannot restore it.

The command has the following pattern:
```rm <file>```

```bash
# Navigate to the nambi24 directory

# Remove file
rm renamed.txt

# Verify

# Remove a file from a different directory
rm ../remove_me.txt

# Verify

# Learn more about the command rm
man rm
```

### Managing folders
```mkdir``` creates new folders. 

The command has the following pattern:
``` mkdir <target> ```

```bash 
# Go to the nambi24 directory

# Create a new directory participant and cd to it

# Copy the copy_me.txt file to "here" (to participant)

# Copy the directory /home/nambi24/data to participant

# Go one level up

# Create another new directory day01

# Move the data directory in particpant to day01

# Remove the directory participant

```
* How can you copy/remove folders with all subfolders and files? Check the documentation of `cp`.

Don't worry, we expect errors and learn from them :) You will learn how to read error messages in this training.
