# Bioinformatics for Influenza Genome Reconstruction: A Hands-On Workshop

## Lesson objectives
* Understand the concepts of absolute and relative paths in navigating the file system.
* Practice managing files and folders through copying, moving, and removing operations.

## Absolute and relative paths
Paths are crucial for navigating the file system, specifying file locations, executing commands, referencing files in scripts, and configuring applications in the Linux environment.

Absolute Paths: These paths start from the root directory `/` and specify the complete directory structure necessary to reach the target file or directory. For example, `/home/mf1/nambi24/file.txt`. Absolute paths provide an exact location irrespective of the current working directory.

Relative Paths: These paths are specified relative to the current working directory. They indicate the location of a file or directory in relation to where the user is currently located in the file system. For instance, if the current directory is `/home/user`, a relative path to a file in the documents directory would be `nambi24/file.txt`. Relative paths are convenient for referencing files and directories within the current directory or its subdirectories.

```bash
# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# List the content of nambi24 using an absolute path
ls -lh /home/mf1/nambi24

# List the content of nambi24 using a relative path
ls -lh nambi24

# Go to nambi24

# List the content of the directory data using a relative path

# Go to data 

# List the content of your current directory

# List the content of the parent directory nambi24 using an absolute path

# List the content of the parent directory nambi24 using a relative path

# Go to your home directory

# Go to data using a relative path

```

## Manage files and folders
### Copy files between folders
```cp``` is a tool that copies data (duplicates).

The command has the following pattern: 
```cp <source> <target>```

```bash
# Navigate to your home directory

# Create a file
touch dummy.txt

# Verify that you have created the file

# Navigate to the nambi24 directory

# Copy the file that you have just created to "here"
cp ../dummy.txt .

# Verify

# Go back to the home directory

# Create a second copy of dummy.txt that and name it dummy2.txt
cp dummy.txt dummy2.txt

# Verify

# Create a third copy of the file and name it dummy3.txt

# Learn more about the command cp
man cp
```


### Move files between folders
```mv``` is a tool that moves and/or renames data (removes source). 

The command has the following pattern
```mv <source> <target>```

```bash

# Navigate to the nambi24 directory

# Move dummy2.txt to here
mv ../dummy2.txt .

# Verify

# Rename file
mv dummy2.txt renamed_dummy2.txt

# Verify

# Learn more about the command mv
man mv
```


### Remove files
```rm``` is a tool that removes data. Always be 100% sure what you delete, because once a file or directory is deleted, you cannot restore it.

The command has the following pattern:
```rm <file>```

```bash
# Navigate to the nambi24 directory

# Delete file
rm renamed_dummy2.txt

# Verify

# Learn more about the command rm
man rm
```


### Managing folders
```mkdir``` creates new folders. 

The command has the following pattern:
``` mkdir <target> ```

```bash 
# Go to the nambi24 directory

# Create a new directory participant and cd to it

# Copy the dummy.txt file to "here" 

# Copy the directory /home/nambi24/data to participant

# Go one level up

# Create another new directory day01

# Move the data directory in particpant to day01

# Remove the directory participant

```
